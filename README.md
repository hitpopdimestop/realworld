# RealWorld Monorepo

This is a monorepo implementation of the RealWorld application using Yarn workspaces. The project consists of four main packages:

- `client-expo-mobx`: React Native mobile application using MobX for state management
- `client-expo-remx`: React Native mobile application using Remx for state management
- `client-expo-context`: React Native mobile application using React Context for state management (AI-generated)
- `server`: Express.js backend server

> This project is based on [Kisilov-Vadim/realworld](https://github.com/Kisilov-Vadim/realworld) and [antonTykhomyrovWix/realworld](https://github.com/antonTykhomyrovWix/realworld), which provided the initial implementations. We've restructured it into a monorepo format and made some improvements to the architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitpopdimestop/realworld.git
cd realworld
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run database migrations (Optional - only if using the local server):

```bash
yarn server:migrate
```

## Server

Start the server (Optional - only if using the local server):

```bash
yarn server
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Client

To run a client application, use the interactive start script:

```bash
yarn start
```

This script will first prompt you to select which API endpoint you want the client to use (local or remote), and then which client implementation (MobX, Remx, or Context) you want to run. Follow the on-screen instructions.

After selecting the API and client, the script will launch the Expo development server for the chosen client. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code, or press 'i' for iOS simulator or 'a' for Android emulator.

## AI-Generated Context Client

The `client-expo-context` package is a complete React Native application that was **entirely generated by AI** without any manual code adjustments. This demonstrates:

- **Zero manual coding**: The entire application architecture, components, navigation, and state management were created by AI
- **Complete functionality**: Includes home screen, post details, API integration, and navigation using Expo Router
- **Modern React patterns**: Uses React Context for state management, following current best practices
- **Production-ready code**: Includes proper TypeScript typing, error handling, and component structure
- **Prompt-driven development**: All changes and iterations were accomplished through natural language prompts, not code editing

This client serves as an example of what can be achieved with AI-assisted development, showing that complex applications can be generated without manual intervention in architecture, code structure, or typing definitions.

**Note**: This README section and assessment is also AI-generated. The evaluation of code quality, architecture decisions, and best practices represents an AI's perspective on the generated codebase. The entire development process was conversational - from initial requirements to final implementation - demonstrating how AI can translate human requirements into working software through iterative prompting.

## Development

- Server API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api`
- The server uses SQLite for local development
- The client is built with React Native and Expo
